# HTML-SASS_Final-Project
Last time I couldn't make the page as responsive as I wanted, so I took care to make it responsive this time.
I am not good at coding with SASS, so I will continue to practice.
I didn't know much about landing pages, so it took me a lot of time because I didn't know what items I needed to include.
It was the second most time-consuming page I have ever created, but I am not satisfied with it, so I would like to create a better page next time.
I now have a better understanding of responsive.
